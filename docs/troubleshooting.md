# Troubleshooting

If you run into error messages relating to OpenAI gym or PyQT, it may be that the version of those libraries that you have installed is incompatible. You can try upgrading specific libraries with pip3, eg: `pip3 install --upgrade gym`. If the problem persists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mila-iqia/babyai/issues/new) on this repository and paste a *complete* error message, along with some information about your platform (are you running Windows, Mac, Linux? Are you running this on a Mila machine?).
